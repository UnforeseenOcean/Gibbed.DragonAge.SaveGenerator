A generator that can create importable Dragon Age: Origins for Dragon Age 2 with user-specified options for plot, characters, etc.

This is the source code to a [tool that was originally released on Bioware Social Network](http://social.bioware.com/project/4242/) in 2011, with some changes:
* General code cleanup.
* Changes have been made to modernize the code to newer versions of my libraries.
* Dependency on Microsoft Expression Blend SDK has been removed.
* Commercial fonts have been replaced with open source/free fonts that have a similar appearance.
* The project has been updated to merge assemblies into a single output executable.
